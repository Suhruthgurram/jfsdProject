	    <h3>Understanding Sustainable Farming</h3>
	    <p>
	        Sustainable farming involves practices like crop rotation, organic farming, and water conservation 
	        to balance economic viability and environmental health.
	    </p>
	    <div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
	        <p>
	            Crop rotation helps prevent soil depletion and controls pests naturally. Organic farming avoids synthetic 
	            pesticides and fertilizers, fostering biodiversity. Water conservation strategies, like drip irrigation 
	            and rainwater harvesting, minimize water wastage, making farming practices more sustainable.

	    <h3>The Role of Technology in Modern Agriculture</h3>
	    <p>
	        Advancements like precision agriculture, automated machinery, and data analytics 
	        are helping farmers optimize resources and increase yields.
	    </p>
	    <div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
	        <p>
	            Precision agriculture uses GPS and sensors to monitor soil conditions and crop health, ensuring 
	            efficient use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. Automated machinery, such as self-driving tractors, 
	            reduces labor costs and enhances productivity. Data analytics provide farmers with insights to make 
	            informed decisions, predicting weather patterns, and managing risks more effectively.

	    <h3>Improving Soil Health for Better Yields</h3>
	    <p>Maintaining soil health through composting, cover cropping, and reduced chemical usage ensures fertile and productive land for farming.</p>
	    <div class="more-content">
	        <p>Composting involves recycling organic matter, such as crop residues and animal waste, into nutrient-rich compost that improves soil structure and fertility. Cover cropping involves planting specific crops during off-season periods to prevent erosion, improve organic matter content, and suppress weeds. Reducing chemical usage, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, minimizes environmental pollution and preserves beneficial soil microorganisms, promoting a balanced and sustainable ecosystem.</p>

	    <h3>Climate Change and Its Impact on Agriculture</h3>
	    <p>Erratic weather patterns, droughts, and floods pose challenges to agriculture, necessitating adaptive strategies like crop diversification.</p>
	    <div class="more-content">
	        <p>Climate change has resulted in unpredictable weather patterns, extreme temperatures, and severe flooding, directly impacting crop yields and livestock health. Strategies such as crop diversification allow farmers to plant a variety of crops to spread risk and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Implementing climate-smart technologies, improving irrigation systems, and utilizing resilient crop varieties are also effective measures. Global efforts like reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable agricultural policies can further mitigate these impacts.</p>

	    <h3>Organic Farming: A Growing Trend</h3>
	    <p>Organic farming reduces chemical dependency, promotes biodiversity, and enhances soil health while meeting the rising demand for organic produce.</p>
	    <div class="more-content">
	        <p>Organic farming avoids synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to cultivate crops and livestock. This practice focuses on natural methods like composting, crop rotation, and the use of beneficial microorganisms to maintain soil health and prevent pests. Organic farming enhances biodiversity by supporting diverse ecosystems and promoting the use of renewable resources. The increasing consumer demand for organic produce, driven by health and environmental concerns, is encouraging more farmers to adopt organic methods as part of their farming strategy.</p>
